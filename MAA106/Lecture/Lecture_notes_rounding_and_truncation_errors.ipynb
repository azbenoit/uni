    "In this chapter, we introduce the fundamental notion of **approximation**, which is the basis of Computational Mathematics. Approximation induces errors that have to be controlled. We focus on two kinds of errors: **round-off errors** due to machine representation of numbers and **truncation errors** due to mathematical approximation. Through examples, we show that mathematical analysis allows to study the behavior of errors and we introduce the notions of **convergence** and **speed of convergence**.\n"

All the algorithms proposed were supposed to give the exact solution to the problem if performed using exact arithmetic. However, for as soon as the problems to be solved become more complicated, there is usually no algorithm that allows to get the exact solution. In that case, one has to design algorithms capable of approximating the solution. One of the main challenges in that case is to obtain algorithms giving \"good\" approximations, that is with \"small\" truncation errors. Before going further, let us define what an algorithm is in the context of this course."

Therefore, we know for instance that, for $h=0.01$ the error is at most equal to $M_1 h = 0.8$ for the first algorithm, and at most equal to $M_2 h^2 = 0.006$ for the second algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, **the explicit estimation of the error also allows to choose adequately the value of the discretization parameter needed to reach a given precision.** For example, suppose you want to approximate $x^*=f'(1)$ and to be precise up to $10^{-6}$. The previous estimation says that you can reach this precision with $h=10^{-6}/M_1=1.25\\times 10^{-8}$ using the first algorithm and $h=\\sqrt{10^{-6}/M_2}\\approx 1.3\\times 10^{-4}$ using the second one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare this results to the errors $\\vert x_h-x^*\\vert$ and $\\vert \\bar x_h-x^*\\vert$ that we explicitly computed before, we see that we are slightly *overestimating* the errors. However, usually we do not know the solution $x^*$ explicitly (otherwise we would not try to use an algorithm to approximate it), and then having an estimation of the error is often the only information we can get."

As a consequence, for $h$ too small, the round-off error can become greater than the truncation error, which deteriorates the approximation. This can be observed for both of the previous algorithms by plotting the error versus $h$ for smaller values of $h$ than in the previous study:"

    "When $h$ is *not too small*, the error is dominated by the truncation error: we observe that, at first, the error seems to go toward zero. Then, below a given value of $h$, the round-off errors become dominant and the total error starts to increase again! One has to be aware of such behaviors to be able to choose efficiently the discretization parameters."

    ">Brook Taylor is an English mathematician and was also musician and painter artist. He is best known for the so-called Taylor's theorem and Taylor series that can be found in its book *Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa* (without rest nor convergence result) . In this book, one can also found the integration by parts formula and the principles of finite differences. It remained quite unknown until the Italian mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange discovered its importance in 1772, to the point of considering Taylor's work to be the *foundation of differential calculus*.
