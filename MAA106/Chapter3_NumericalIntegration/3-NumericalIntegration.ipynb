    "- While Newton-Cotes quadrature rules do not behave well when $n$ becomes too large, Clenshaw-Curtis and Gauss-Legendre rules both have very good theoretical properties: they converge for any continuous function, and the smoother the function the faster the convergence. However, even for Clenshaw-Curtis and Gauss-Legendre rules, one has to be mindful about how the weights are computed for large $n$ (there exist good algorithms to compute these weights in a stable and efficient manner, but this goes beyond the scope of this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form the viewpoint of the degree of accuracy, Gauss-Legendre rules are superior to Clenshaw-Curtis rules, but when we look at the error for $n$ large there is not always a big difference between the two."

    "> Nicholas Constantine Metropolis is a Greek-American physicist. In the 1950s, a group of researchers led by Metropolis, including John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo method. This term describes a broad class of algorithms relying on random sampling. The basic idea is to use randomness to solve deterministic problems. These kind of methods are now widely used, for instance in optimization, integration and probability."
